                <p>WE LIVE IN a throwaway culture. Long gone are the days when you’d buy anything – a house, a car, a washing machine, lawnmower – and expect it to last a lifetime.</p>
                <div class="dark"><p>Now items are made to last for a lifetime, as long as you’re a gerbil. New-build flats get erected and within weeks repair works begin; owners of old bangers are coerced into upgrading to newer cars by punitive road tax and insurance fees; consumer electronics advance so quickly that you’ve just about set up your latest TV when the next HD/3D/4K/Ultra HD version comes along</p></div>
